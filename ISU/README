Welcome to our tank game!
Throughout our coding journey, we have had our ups and downs but in the end, this is our product.


Missing and additional functionalities:
Although our game is great, we are missing a feature from our original plan and that is the leaderboard. 
However, we decided to compensate that by adding abilities for enemies to make the levels harder. This includes
	- Adjusting the speed of the bullet 
	- Adjusting the speed of the tank


Bugs:
1. this.slope is null
We think this happens when the slope is 0 but we’re not sure what the problem is
2. Index 0 out of bounds for 0
We don’t know why this happens, but we suspect it has to do something with an ArrayList we made that are responsible for the tanks


Hints:
To skip levels in our game, go to the method “initialize” and you can manually change the levels in the code
